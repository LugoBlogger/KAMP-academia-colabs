# KAMP-academia-colabs

## Foreword

After several long discussion in our online group, we found that by collaborating our mind to solve the real world problem in Indonesia is better than by working in solitude. We believe by combining our same spirit in science, we can make a small breakthrough in science faster, reliable, and marketable (in a sense of academia community). We also seek an opportunity to develop basic science in Indonesia since most of Indonesian people lost their hope to develop basic science because the basic needs of sufficient funding is lower than expected. Self-sufficient funding is one of our main goals to make this group can work as we hope.

We tried to be useful both in industrial and academic institutional. Most of our members may work part-time contributor.

Right now, we limited our scope to discuss the problem in physics, mathematics, and computer science. For further development, we may open to merge to another branch of sciences.

By using this platform, we try to gather some important thoughts and ideas to get better and correct understanding about science. 
We tried as hard as possible to give full-fledged information from the beginning to the current research.

## How to contribute to this repo

1. Join as a collaborator (only for members who want to dedicate themselves to this colaborations) or fork this repo.

2. Create a new directory with this format: `<main_subject>-<main_topic>-<sub-topic>`. Several examples that you can use:
    - `physics-mathematical_physics` 
    - `physics-computational_physics_social-physics`
    - `physics-high_energy_physics-muon_scattering`
    - `physics-applied_physics`
    - `physics-biophysics`
    - `mathematics-algebraic_topology`
    - `mathematics-differential_geometry`
    - `computer_science-quantum-computing`
    
    If you find that your research is intersect to another domain of sub-topic please pick one name that fits to represent your research domain.
  
3. Provide the directory with your work. It can be your research summary, useful resource for learning (textbook, paper, video lecture, articles, computer program, infographics, etc.). Feel free to create your own directory structure inside the directory that you have just created in step 2). Some basic template that you can use:
    
    ```
      <main_subject>-<main_topic>-<sub-topic>
      ├─── <your_introductory_research_interest>
      ├─── <your_current_research>
      ├─── <some-important-references>
      ├─── <your-computer-program>
    ```


## General resources

- Some useful framework to develop your locat Git history repo (["A tidy linear Git history"](https://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-tidy-linear-git-history/))
- Simple classification of your domain in science:
  - [Map of Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZihywtixUYo)
  - [Map of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y)
  - [Map of Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJ46YA_RaA)
  
  For more advanced structure, you can follow these schemes:

  - [Mathematical Science Classification System](https://zbmath.org/static/msc2020.pdf)
  - [ACM Computing Classification System](https://dl.acm.org/ccs)

## To do list.

1. Create a podcast or summary to your research such that it is reachable both for expert and non-expert in your subject.

2. (under development and discussion)
